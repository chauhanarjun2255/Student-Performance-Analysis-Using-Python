## 🔍 Tasks Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Loaded dataset using Pandas with correct delimiter handling.

### 2️⃣ Data Exploration
- Checked dataset shape
- Inspected column data types
- Verified missing values

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values using median
- Removed duplicate records

### 4️⃣ Data Analysis
- Calculated average final grade (G3)
- Identified students scoring above 15
- Analyzed correlation between study time and final grade
- Compared average grades by gender

### 5️⃣ Data Visualization
- Histogram of final grades
- Scatter plot of study time vs final grade
- Bar chart comparing average grades by gender

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- The average final grade provides an overview of student performance.
- A positive correlation exists between study time and final grades.
- Gender-based comparison shows variation in academic performance.
- Visualizations help in understanding trends and distributions clearly.
